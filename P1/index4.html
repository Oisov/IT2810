                <p> In 2006
                    <strong>Bouygues Telecom</strong> and <strong>Vodafone</strong> decided
                    to merge. As this was a controversial merger between the
                    biggest internet provider in respectively Germany and
                    France, they decided to renew with a new company name
                    and logo. The company logo was choosen through a
                    competition between 12 renowned artists, 6 from Germany
                    and 6 from France. <i>Urszula Donovan</i> won with
                    the contribution you see below.

            <div class="cols color-box hidden"><h2>CSS-grid and Flexbox-layout</h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning every website was designed to be used on a
                    PC-monitor with a keyboard and mouse, however today we have
                    hundreds of different devices that connect to the web,
                    varying largely in sizes. This initially ushered a sharp
                    distinction between desktop and mobile sites, where apps
                    were the dominating way to interact with websites. Flexbox
                    and CSS-grid is one way to bridge this gap with new
                    responsive design techniques, and using these tools it is
                    much easier to design websites that can be rendered on a
                    3.5" smartphone or a 55" TV.

                    The main difference is that Flexbox is made for one
                    dimensional layouts and Grid is made for two dimensional
                    layouts.Another core difference between the two is that
                    Flexbox takes basis in the <i>content</i> while Grid takes basis in
                    the <i>layout</i>. In practice this means it is easier to
                    add rows and columns to flexbox, while the Grid initialized
                    first.

                <p>
                    jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library where the main
                    purposeis to make it much easier to use JavaScript on a
                    website. jQuery has many benefits such as displaying
                    elements even when JavaScript is disabled, and makes
                    animated applications like Flash. As jQuery code often is
                    simpler and shorter, it can also reduce the loading times of
                    your website.
